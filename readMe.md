The bubble sort will sort everything from smallest to largest.

i starts at the end of the Array then it is decremented all indexes greater before it is sorted.

The inner loop starts at the beginning of the array and compares each value next to each other. If the value is greater then they are swapped.

The Binary Search is quicker than the linear search because all the values are sorted. Because everything is sorted once you get to a number larger than what you are looking for you can stop the search. Also you be able to start searching from the middle which speeds the search. It also works best when there are no duplicates.

Selection sort search for the smallest number in the array saves it in the minimum spot and then repeats searching through the entire array each time.

The Insertion Sort is normally the best of the elementary sorts. Unlike the other sorts that had a group sorted at any given time, groups are only partially sorted here.
